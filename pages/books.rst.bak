Research Interests
------------------
My primary research interests are information theory, measure theory and their applications to PAC learning. The surge of applications in which machine learning (ML) provides the technological backbone, has propelled the technology to the forefront of research. My research focuses on understanding the fundamental limits of attainable generalization via regularization in supervised learning settings.


--------
Overview
--------
I received my BEng in Mechatronic and Robotic Engineering from the University of Sheffield, UK in 2018 and an MSc in Advanced Control and Systems Engineering from the University of Sheffield, UK in 2019. I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at The University of Sheffield, and a Visiting PhD Candidate in INRIA, Centre de Recherche de Sophia Antipolis, France.
In 2019-2020 I was a Control Systems Engineer at Huber+Suhner Polatis, Cambridge, UK. My research interests include information theory and control theory problems with incomplete or mismatched system information.
