Research Interests
------------------
My research focuses on understanding the implications the use of incomplete information in PAC learning. The surge of applications in which machine learning (ML) provides the technological backbone, has propelled the technology to the forefront of research. By analysing the impact incomplete information mai research aims at deepening our understanding on the fundamental limits of attainable generalization via regularization in supervised learning settings.


--------
Overview
--------
I received my BEng in Mechatronic and Robotic Engineering from the University of Sheffield, UK in 2018 and an MSc in Advanced Control and Systems Engineering from the University of Sheffield, UK in 2019. I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at The University of Sheffield, and Member of NEO Team at INRIA, Centre de Recherche de Sophia Antipolis, France.

In 2019-2020 I was a Control Systems Engineer at Huber+Suhner Polatis, Cambridge, UK. My research interests include information and control theory applied to problems with incomplete or mismatched system information.
